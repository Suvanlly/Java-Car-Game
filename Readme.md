The objective of the game is for the player (human) to control a car on a highway. <br />

The player must dodge obstacles on the highway and outrun the authorities that are pursuing them. The player begins the game on a random lane on a three-lane highway. With each turn, the player has to make a choice between a few alternatives in order to attempt to escape the authorities. <br />

While traversing the highway, the player will encounter obstacles, some of which offer benefits and others that should be avoided. The vehicle the player starts with has certain characteristics such as boost speed, max fuel, and damage sustainable. These characteristics determine the success or failure of the pursuit. The pursuing authorities will attempt to stop the player at any cost. <br />

The game ends when the player sustains damage greater than the maximum sustainable to their vehicle, runs out of fuel, or manages to get to the end of the highway.<br />
